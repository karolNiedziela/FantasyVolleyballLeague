# 🏐 Fantasy Volleyball League & Match Stats Aggregator

This project is a web-based fantasy sports application focused on professional volleyball, with a special emphasis on PlusLiga (Polish Men's Volleyball League). It allows users to create fantasy teams using real players and earn points based on their actual performance in real matches.
